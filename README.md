Kitchensink-Android
===================

This application provides a compilation of various use-cases for Kinvey's Android library.

Try features such as:

* Allow users to sign up and log in.
* See AppData functionality in action, by saving and retrieving entities.
* Upload and Download text files through our File API.
* Try out Push notifications.
* Set up a Custom Endpoint and use it
* Perform User lookup and modify the current User


## Set up Kitchensink Project

1. Download the [Kitchensink](https://github.com/KinveyApps/StatusShare-Android/archive/master.zip) project.
2. Download the latest Kinvey library (zip) and extract the downloaded zip file, from: http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android/downloads


###Android Studio
1. In Android Studio, go to **File &rarr; New &rarr; Import Project**
2. **Browse** to the extracted zip from step 1, and click **OK**
3. Click **Next** and **Finish**.
4. Copy all jars in the **libs/** folder of the Kinvey Android library zip to the **lib/** folder at the root of the project
5. Within the `Top-level` build.gradle script, add the following repository:

	```
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://dl.bintray.com/populov/maven" }
    }
    ```
    

6.  Click the **play** button to start a build, if you still see compilation errors ensure the versions are correctly defined in the dependencies list

###Finally, for all IDEs
7. Specify your app key and secret in `assets/kinvey.properties` constant variables
`app.key` and `app.secret`

##Set up a Custom Endpoint

One of the features used in this application is a Custom Endpoint, which must be created on your backend.  The Custom Endpoint used in this sample application just returns a hard-coded String, however [take a look at the business logic guide](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android/guides/business-logic) for more information about what can be accomplished with Custom Endpoints.

1.  Visit [the Kinvey console, and login to your application](http://console.kinvey.com) and go to the Custom Endpoint add-on

    ![Custom Endpoint add-on](https://raw.github.com/KinveyApps/Kitchensink-Android/master/assets/android-oauth1-tutorial-custom.png)

2.  Create a new Custom Endpoint, named `doit`.  

3.  Paste the following code into the javascript editor:

    ```
    function onRequest(request, response, modules){  
        response.body = [{"resp": "Hit a custom Endpoint!"}];
        response.complete(201);
    }
    ```
    
4.  The class `com.kinvey.sample.kitchensink.custom.EndpointFragment` consumes this Endpoint, so make sure the first parameter of `callEndpoint(â€¦)` matches the name of the Custom Endpoint (in this case, `doit`).
 
 
##Configure Push Notifications
 
Push Notifications are tied to the application's package context, so you will have to change the package declaration to configure push notifications.


1.  Perform a global find and replace in your editor of choice replacing `com.kinvey.sample.kitchensink` with a unique package name.  Note this must be done in the Manifest, and in all classes.  If you use an automated refactor tool, ensure that all instances of the string have been replaced.

2.  [Take a look at our Push Configuration guide, and register for Push notifications](http://devcenter.kinvey.com/android/guides/push) to get started!
